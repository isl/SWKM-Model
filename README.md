==========

The ICS-FORTH SWKM Model: A Main Memory RDF/S Management System. 

SWKM Model is a Main Memory RDF/S Management System. Unlike most known RDF parsers, it provides both an Object-based Model and a Triple-based Model for Main Memory RDF manipulation. The Model is not intended to be either a persistence storage model or a model that can be updated programmatically in main memory.
